// A pinned tab on the phone: its button on the phone bar, before the address
// or, beside the iPhone Duo's strip, after it, while the tab on screen is
// pinned; and what it opens. A tap has the tab's options, in the system's
// menu. Held a moment, or moved up at once, it has the space's pinned tabs
// in a panel of its own (PinnedPanel), the tab on screen under the finger
// and the others above it, a highlight following the finger from one to the
// next and letting go going there, as a menu held open is used. Lifted
// without going anywhere, the list stays for a tap.
//
// Motion: the button becomes the list. Its rounded square of glass grows
// into the card (corners 17 to 30) on a critically damped spring of 0.3
// seconds, the window behind dimming and blurring with it; the tab on
// screen's row is where the button was, its icon on the button's, and the
// others rise into place over it, nearest first, 25 ms apart, easing out
// strongly. Going, faster: the other rows fade in 0.1 seconds and the card
// goes back into the button on a spring of 0.24, the button coming back
// over it. The highlight moves between rows on a 0.15 second spring; the
// button gives to 0.96 under the finger. Under Reduce Motion nothing grows
// or moves: the dim, the card and the rows fade.
//
// Felt: a medium tap as the list opens, a selection tick at each row the
// finger reaches, a soft tap as it leaves the rows (letting go there does
// nothing), and a light one as letting go goes to a tab.
